Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
I've created a function called inputStudentMarks which prompts the user for input(which are the marks), validates the input, and correctly maps the input to the appropriate grade.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
I've created a function called checkCarSpeed takes speed input, evaluates it, and prints the appropriate message or demerit points.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
I've created a function called calculateIndividualNetSalary that correctly calculates the net salary including tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions.
